    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Developer in server side Java for (sum of single digit prime numbers) years.
      Primary role at work is to design, develop backend logic according to 
      the requirements and provide APIs for frontend developers to do their magic 
      rendering pages with data.

      It's been over a decade I am in the same big suite of enterprise web 
      applications. Platform mordenizations, Application server configuration 
      and tuning, RESTful integrations, build and deployment management, source
      control management, research and analysis to improve the application, addressing 
      production issues... OMG its handsful!

      Backend development path using Java is good and more often its quite 
      challenging. I like it. But being blind on the whole world of frontend
      is terribly bad. So many times I wondered "Wow ! What a beautiful 
      responsive UI design is this !!". 
      
      When I see words like ReactJS, GatsbyJS, NodeJS and a whole bunch of others,
      I couldn't see myself fitting anywhere. But its never too late to learn. Isn't it? 
      So I decided to learn the frontend technologies right from grassroot level.
      This site is my beginning. Its a place to record the progress of my learning.

      I put effort. I get a sense of satisfaction. Its as simple as that :-)

      So, here I go !!!.

      Learning HTML, CSS, JS, React........
